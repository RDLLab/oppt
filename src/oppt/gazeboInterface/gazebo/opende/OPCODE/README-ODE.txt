This is a copy of the OPCODE collision detection library by Pierre Terdiman.
See http://www.codercorner.com/Opcode.htm for more information, and read
the ReadMe.txt in this directory.

If you want to use the TriList (triangle mesh) geometry class in ODE, the
OPCODE library must be compiled. If you are using the autotools support to 
compile ODE, you just have to specify --with-trimesh=opcode when calling ./configure.

This code was originally written for and compiled on windows, but it has been
ported so that it should compile under unix/gcc too. Your mileage may vary.
